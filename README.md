Overview
This repository demonstrates an image classification task using transfer learning with the VGG16 model. The project applies advanced data augmentation techniques, model fine-tuning, and visualization of metrics to classify images into multiple categories. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and results visualization.

Features
Transfer Learning: Fine-tunes a pre-trained VGG16 model on a custom dataset.
Data Augmentation: Uses rotation, shift, shear, and flipping to enhance dataset variability.
Custom Metrics: Implements F1-score alongside standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
Training & Validation: Visualizes model performance over epochs using accuracy, loss, and other metrics.
Callbacks: Utilizes Early Stopping, Model Checkpoint, and Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau for efficient training.

Dataset
The dataset is divided into three folders:

train/: Training images with subfolders for each class.
valid/: Validation images with subfolders for each class.
test/: Test images with subfolders for each class.
Ensure the dataset structure matches this format:

bash

Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator.
Rescales pixel values to [0, 1].
Splits data into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Model Architecture
Base model: VGG16 with pre-trained ImageNet weights.
Custom top layers for classification:
Dropout for regularization.
Dense layers with ReLU activation.
Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
3. Training
Loss function: categorical_crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC, F1-score
Callbacks:
EarlyStopping: Stops training when validation loss stops improving.
ModelCheckpoint: Saves the best model.
ReduceLROnPlateau: Adjusts learning rate when validation loss stagnates.
4. Evaluation
Evaluates the model on the test set.
Outputs metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, F1-score.
5. Visualization
Plots training vs. validation metrics (accuracy, loss, precision, F1-score, etc.).
